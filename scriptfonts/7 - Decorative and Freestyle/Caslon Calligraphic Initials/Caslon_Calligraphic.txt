The joys of re-living the past.  Shame one can't be young again though, but the classics live on.

The first of the first.  'Casxlon Initials' was my very first effort at building a font.  Now I've come back full circle with this new generation "Caslon Calligraphic".

Still a lovely design for the initial capital of a page of Roman type, I think, especially offset nicedly in a grey screen.
