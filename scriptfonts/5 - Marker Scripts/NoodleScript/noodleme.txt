Thanks for downloading NOODLE SCRIPT

DESCRIPTION:

NOODLE SCRIPT is a revival of sorts. I saw a sample in a book printed in the 1930's. The original typeface was called "Romany," and I've never seen its like in digital font format--and I've pored over a lot of recent (last ten years) specimens and font catalogs. So as an excercise, I thought I'd try to produce something similar. The result is admittedly a lot less artful than the original, yet, despite the warts, this font has some charm. Maybe.

This font is free to use in all your designs and layouts. NOODLE SCRIPT may be duplicated and given away as often as you see fit, as long as you INCLUDE THIS README FILE. If you use this font in a commercial layout, I'd be really surprised. I'd be even more surprised if you actually dropped me a line, or sent me a sample of such a layout.

INSTALLING NOODLE SCRIPT:

MACINTOSH:
For System 7 and above, just drag both the screen font and the printer font files onto your system folder icon. Finder will prompt you whether or not to add them to your Fonts folder; click OK and you're set! If you're using font management software like Suitcase, consult your user's manual for further instruction.

WINDOWS:

Windows 3.1: Open the control panel and choose FONTS
Click the ADD button, find the TrueType font, and click OK.

Windows 95 and above: Open the Windows FONT folder; click, drag, and drop the TrueType font inside.
