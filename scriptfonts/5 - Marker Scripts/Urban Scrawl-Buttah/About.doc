About UrbanScrawl

Thanks for trying GM UrbanScrawl!
It's a capital graffiti font with all the regular numbers & punctuation, plus smart quotes and arrows on the shift and shift-option <> keys. If there's a demand for all of the other characters in the Macintosh character set (symbols, accented letters, etc.) I could be enticed to make them (but no insignia, please). For now, though, enjoy the sights of the city on your own screen and in your documents. GM UrbanScrawl is a set of three fonts, Buttah, Chill, & Down, each heavier than the first. You can make a triple outline or other fat effects by using text blocks layered one over another.

Use GM UrbanScrawl Buttah to set a text in a page layout program; copy the block, paste it, select the text, and make it GM UrbanScrawl Chill. Make it a grey or a color that will print well on your greyscale printer. 
Send the block behind the Buttah block; select the Buttah block and make it white, and align the blocks to get a heavier outline behind the Buttah block. 

Repaste the text block, select the text, and make it another color or shade. Make it GM Urban Scrawl Down; align it with the other two blocks and send it behind both of the other two blocks. 

Yo, instant mad graffiti! 
Use colors in a paint program (I used MicroFrontier's Color It 30 PPC, bricks included) for a real street look.
