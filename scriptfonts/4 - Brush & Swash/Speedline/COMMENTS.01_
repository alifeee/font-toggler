Speedline 1.01 TT & T1 - Speedline is a typeface that duplicates the hand-lettering used by sign painters to create lettering with the look of speed for signs, banners, posters, etc. Now you can have this same look with the convenience of a laser font. The many uses this font has to offer include - ads, newsletters, display headlines, etc. This typeface also includes many of the special characters supported by Apple computers. (Use Key Caps or some other program to find the characters you need.) Remember, even if you use this font only once, it's well worth the asking price. TrueType and PostScript Type One fonts included.
