________________________________________________

This typeface was written at Madrid in 1570, by a man called Francisco Lucas. Employing the Spanish term for a cursive hand, he called it a Bastarda; but technically speaking, it is a humanistic cursive. 

There is no number sign in this font. In its place, you'll find a long s. You'll find alternates in other places as well:

- a more swashed E instead of the left bracket
- a slender Z instead of the right bracket
- a very swashed R instead of the left curly bracket
- a slender K instead of the right curly bracket
- a final e instead of the bar sign
- a double long s on the long s sign
- as well as an st and a ct ligature on the fi and fl keys.

In case the fi and fl aren't reachable on your computer, you might find these ligatures on the masculine and feminine ordinal indicators, or the 'less than or equal to' and the 'greater than or equal to' signs.

Update 2007 has reduced the file size, by redesigning the composite glyphs, and has corrected some details and flaws -- among others, the lcedilla, and the L/ldot.
